# BroadFire Ai - Research Lab Landing Page

An interactive, high-performance landing page for a research lab specializing in Embodied Agents, Spatial Intelligence, and Edge AI. This project features advanced procedural WebGL shaders using Three.js, a custom design system with Tailwind CSS, and a responsive React architecture.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Shaders:** Custom GLSL shaders for procedural fire effects and chromatic aberration post-processing.
- **Modern Stack:** Built with React 19, TypeScript, and Three.js.
- **Styling:** Utility-first styling with Tailwind CSS, utilizing a custom serif typography system (Playfair Display & Lora).
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for all device sizes with fluid grids and layouts.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Node.js** (version 16.0 or higher) installed on your machine.

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd broadfire-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

## 💻 Development

To start the local development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal).

## 🏗 Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` (or `build`) folder containing the compiled assets, optimized for performance.

## 👁 Preview Production Build

To preview the production build locally before deploying:

```bash
npm run preview
```
